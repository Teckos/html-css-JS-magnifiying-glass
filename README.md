# html-css-JS-magnifiying-glass
Quick project after completing the html/css/js courses on sololearn.com

I'm using big images on purpose to give the impression there's a real zoom on the backgrounds. 
If you look carefully into the code you'll notice there's actually no zooming on the background displayed block. 
Instead I'm using another bloc that uses the unstretched large image on the fore ground. The circle clipping then does the trick ^^
The fun part was to move the "zoomed cropped" area properly according to the mouse movement without it moving all over the place.
